# Kayla Gilbert

QA Engineer. Test automation and internal tooling. Bentonville, AR (remote).

**Live site:** [snackdriven.com](https://snackdriven.com)

## What's here

Two-page portfolio site. Vanilla HTML and CSS, no frameworks, no build step. It didn't need React and I refused to give it React.

- `index.html` — resume (experience, stack, what I'm looking for)
- `projects.html` — project writeups with tech details

Print styles built in. The resume prints to a clean single-page PDF with a light theme and ATS-friendly fonts.

## About me

I own QA for 8 behavioral health products. When something is slow or broken or annoying, I usually end up building a small tool to fix it. 14 scripts and counting. Most of my repos are private because they're either half-finished or contain my unhinged commit messages.
