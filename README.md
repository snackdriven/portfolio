# Kayla Gilbert

QA Systems Specialist. Bentonville, AR (remote). I break things for a living and occasionally build things to break them faster.

**Live site:** [snackdriven.github.io/portfolio](https://snackdriven.github.io/portfolio/)

## What's here

Single-page resume. Vanilla HTML and CSS, no frameworks, no build step. It didn't need React and I refused to give it React.

Dark theme with green/magenta accents. Prints clean in black and white for the recruiters who still print resumes in 2026.

## About me

I test complex healthcare software that nobody else wants to touch. When something is slow or broken or annoying, I usually end up building a small tool to fix it. Most of my repos are private because they're either half-finished or contain my unhinged commit messages.
